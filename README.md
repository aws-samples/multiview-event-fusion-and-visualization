## Multi-camera event detection visualization and analysis using SageMaker
Thie repository is based on our blog post found here(). We've created a notebook to download videos from the NFL kaggle competition, process the ground truth data and create visualizations.

To download the example videos and the `train_labels.csv`, visit the [NFL Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nfl-impact-detection/data) and download any corresponding endzone-sideline videos and the `train_labels.csv` to the working directory.
